The **l10n.csv** format decodes comma-separated localization data into a
LocalizationTable instance, where the data is assigned to the Contents
property.

| Direction | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decode | [Instance](/api/types/Instance) | A LocalizationTable with a Contents property. |
| Encode | Stringable | Any string-like value. |

Decoded data is a string in JSON format with the following structure:

```
[
	{
		"key":      "string",
		"context":  "string",
		"examples": "string",
		"source":   "string",
		"values": {
			"locale": "string",
			...
		},
	},
	...
]

```

Well-formed data has certain constraints, which are described in the [LocalizationTable page](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalizationTable)
of the DevHub. rbxmk applies these same constraints when encoding and
decoding. To avoid data loss, they are applied more strictly. Rather than
discarding data, any conflict that arises will throw an error that describes the
conflict in detail.
